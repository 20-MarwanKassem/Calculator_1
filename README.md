Use a Python environment to run the program.
The program will show a menu with the options listed below:
Divide, Multiply, Add, Subtract
For the chosen operation, enter the relevant number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
The software will prompt you to submit a correct choice and display an error notice if you enter an invalid input.
The application will ask you to enter two numbers on which to perform the operation if you select a valid operation. The program will display an error notice and ask you to enter a correct number if you enter an invalid number.
The application will prompt you once more if you enter an invalid input during the continuation prompt.
So until you decide to end the software, you can conduct numerous calculations.
Note: The software does not actually divide by zero; instead, it displays an error message.
